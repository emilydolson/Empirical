Files in Empirical are grouped into meaningful folders.  Most folders are also duplicated
in examples/ where example code for the associated functionality should be included.

Files should have one of the following statuses:

* DESIGN - Notes are in place, but no (or minimal) working code
* ALPHA - Some basic functionality works, but more features still need to be added and tested
* BETA - Basic functionality is all in place, but needs more thorough testing.
* RELEASE - Well-tested functionality and used in multiple projects, at least by authors.
* STABLE - Used by many non-authors in assorted projects without fixes for extended period.

* ABANDONED - May have worked, or may not; no longer being developed.
* BROKEN - Once worked (at least BETA level), but now needs to be repaired (not abandoned!)
* CLEANUP - At least BETA, but need code cleanup, fixing of warnings, etc.
* DEPRECATED - Functionality has been replaced and should shift to replacement.
* EXPLORATORY - Some functionality may work, but needs re-engineering to get right.
* EXTERNAL - Part of another project (cited above); not developed as part of Empirical.
